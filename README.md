### Crowdfunding Dapp

- Create a campaign
- Get contributors
- Make requests to the contributors to spend their contributed Eth on something specific and to a specific address
- Get majority vote yes and contract automatically sends the Ether to specified address
- Crowdfunding without the risk of campaign creator taking money/spending it incorrectly, etc. because contract holds the contributions until voted upon for use as apposed to creator getting funds.
